## Background and Motivation

## Project Objectives
This visulization is to help understand the steps each simulation (I don't know exactly what to call your project) takes.  The simulator has been made using C++.  The visualization will be constructed using Javascript and d3.  With the design the viewer should be able to see trends that lead to team success or reward.  The viewer should also be able to see stats on each team given a specific time location during a simulation.  This will help give the game designers and viewers necessary information towards understanding what is occuring during the game and why a team wins while another team loses.

## Data
The data for this visualization is gathered during each simulation.  The simulation generates a binary file of information.  The file will contain time stamps.  At each time stamp the locations and stats of the team units are recorded.  Information such as health, food, supplies, and reward are recorded for each unit.  The number of units for the simulation can vary.  The game can be played with a small amount of links and nodes, 10 nodes, or a large amount of links and nodes, 1000 nodes.  

## Data Processing
The data will be complete. Because the simulation provides the information needed there should not be any values that are missing or that need approximating.  From the data the overall stats for the team will be available.  This will be a summary of health o
